# audioguide-snippets package

AudioGuide Command Snippets.

Usage :

Snippets allow you to enter a simple prefix in the editor and hit "Tab" to expand the prefix into a larger code block with templated values. We can continue pressing Tab and the cursor will move to the next value of the body tag or "Shift+Tab" to go backwards.

To see all the available snippets for the AudioGuide file type that you currently have open, choose "Snippets: Available" in the Command Palette "Shif+Cmd+P":
