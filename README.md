AudioGuide Command Snippets.

Install :

This is an Atom Editor Package. Go to Atom's preferences then to the Install tab.
Search for the audioguide-snippets package then click install (re-launch Atom if necessary).

Usage :

Snippets allow you to enter a simple prefix in the editor and hit "Tab" to expand the prefix into a larger code block with templated values. We can continue pressing Tab and the cursor will move to the next value of the body tag or "Shift+Tab" to go backwards.
